# sacco-management-system
This the source code of a software for managing finance sacco, with member management, contribution management and loan and liability management

The system was designed using C#. NET Version 4.6, it uses Crystal Reports for reporting and MS Access 2007 for a database. The database is used as passive storage mechanism and does not do anything else other than storing the data. All the processing is done by the database. 

Please note: some component may be missing or not working as advertised because the source code has not been tested in a working environment at all. You can contact me incase you need any help modifying this source code.
